All were produced by code version DS1.py, which ran slowly but got there in the end.
1st to 4th outputs were generated by a MacOS machine.
5th to 10th outputs were generated by a Ubuntu machine.
I intend to continue developing DS5.py, which should be faster (although that is what I said about versions 2-4, which crash on "out of memory" for most inputs)
