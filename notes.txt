Today, I confirmed:
	(by sorting) that DS1.py has the correct output for 5.in
	both DS1.py and DS5.py found expendable crew members, so they return coverage by all

All were produced by code version DS1.py, which ran slowly but got there in the end.
1st to 4th outputs were generated by a MacOS machine.
5th to 10th outputs were generated by a Ubuntu machine.
I intend to continue developing DS5.py, which should be faster (although that is what I said about versions 2-4, which crash on "out of memory" for most inputs)
