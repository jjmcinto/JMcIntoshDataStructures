As the instructions for the setup of the Git repositories are somewhat vague, I set them up to be private and gave access only to catherine.fang@sv.cmu.edu.

Part 2: Data Structures Assignment
	For my final submission in this part, kindly use DS5.py.
	
	Notes: 
		I attempted multiple approaches to this problem and named them DS1.py through DS5.py. The last, DS5.py, is the best.
		
		DS1: On my MacBook Pro, it runs the ten inputs and generates output files over the course of several hours.
		DS2-4: These either take too long to even try to finish or crash from "Out of Memory" errors on the larger inputs.
		DS5: On my MacBook Pro, it runs the ten inputs and generates output files within 40 seconds altogether.
